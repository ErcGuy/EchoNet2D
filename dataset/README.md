# Dataset Instructions

This folder is intended to hold the FreiHAND dataset version 2 (FreiHAND_pub_v2).

Due to the large size, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.

Follow below instructions to set up and download

## Dataset Setup

1. Download the FreiHAND dataset v2 from the official page:  
   [https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FreiHAND.en.html](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FreiHAND.en.html)

2. Unzip the downloaded files.

3. Place the unzipped folder inside your project directly in the 'dataset' folder (this one) under `dataset/FreiHAND_pub_v2/` so that files like `evaluation_K.json` and folders like `evaluation/rgb/` are accessible at paths like:  
   `dataset/FreiHAND_pub_v2/evaluation_K.json`  
   `dataset/FreiHAND_pub_v2/evaluation/rgb/`
